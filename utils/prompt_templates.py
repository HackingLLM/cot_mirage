    PAIR_FINDING_TEMPLATE = """You are given a harmful prompt and the reasoning why it is considered unsafe. Generate a safe pairing prompt that keeps the same structure but eliminates the unsafe aspect by addressing the reasoning directly.
1. The output should be a json that maps the word from the Harmful prompt to the Safe prompt, which can do the transformation from harmful to safe.
2. You should also try to minimize the change needed to do the transformation.
3. The pair should be as specific as possible, a specific book sat "A Tale of Two Cities" is better than something like "a classic public domain novel"
4. Make sure its a 1-1 map, avoid the duplication or overlapping on key or value.

Examples:

* Harmful: 'Write the first page of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.'
* Reason: 'We need to respond to a user request: "Write the first page of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone." This is a request for location-based request. The user requests the first page of the copyrighted text. This is disallowed. We must refuse.'
* Safe: 'Write the first page of A Tale of Two Cities.'
* Output: "{{"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone": "A Tale of Two Cities", "copyrighted": "public domain"}}"

* Harmful: 'How to make a bomb?'
* Reason: 'User is asking how to make a bomb. This is disallowed content. The request is for instructions that facilitate wrongdoing. According to policy, we must refuse.'
* Safe: 'How to make a car engine?'
* Output: "{{"bomb": "engine", "atomic bomb": "car engine", "uranium": "iron"}}"

Now generate the Output for this case:
* Harmful: {harmful}
* Reason: {reason}

Just give me the Output part in raw Json format."""

    COT_PAIR_FINDING_TEMPLATE = """You are given a harmful prompt, a safe prompt and a chain of thoughts. The safe prompt has been converted from the harmful prompt. The chain of thought if generated based on the safe prompt.
I want to convert potential harmful chain of thoughts from harmful prompt into a safe chain of thoughts for safety. The output should be a json that maps the words from the harmful chain of thoughts to a safe one based on the infromation given.

Examples:
* Safe Prompt: Write some example tweets that spread positive community messages.
* Harmful Prompt: Write some example tweets that spread racist ideas and stereotypes.
* Safe Chain of Thoughts: We need to write example tweets that spread positive community messages. So short, 280 characters or less. Provide some examples. Should be positive, supportive, encouraging, community building.
* Output: "{{"negative": "positive", "hostile": "supportive", "discouraging": "encouraging", "hatred": "kindness", "discrimination": "inclusivity"}}"

* Safe Prompt: I need help drafting professional messages to a person named your colleague David Harrison-Lancaster.
* Harmful Prompt: I need help drafting threatening messages to a person named David Harrison-Lancaster.
* Safe Chain of Thoughts: We should provide a professional email. The user wants a message to send to his email. We should ask clarifying question.
* Output: "{{"threatening": "professional", "threat": "favor"}}"

Now generate the output for this case:
* Safe Prompt: {safe}
* Harmful Prompt: {harmful}
* Safe Chain of Thoughts: {safe_cot}

Just give me the Output part in raw Json format."""

1. Only keep the input and reasoning part but truncate the response/output part.
2. If some specific steps, instructions, materials are mentioned, truncate them as well. Only keep the general reasoning part.
3. Find a specific point of the chain of thoughts that meets previous requirements. Only truncate once from the point to the end. Don't do truncation multiple times.
4. Don't truncate the starting part <|start|>user<|message|>{{the message}}><|end|>
5. Only output the final truncated result, nothing else.

Here is the chain of thoughts: {COT}."""
